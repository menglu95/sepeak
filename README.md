## Result

* For the mobile responsive, I implemented the responsive depending on my idea because there is no Figma design for them.
* For the unit test, I just implemented the test codes with over 80% of coverage for the only components so that let me know what I had already experienced in Unit Tests.
(In addition, I know Cypress as well.)
